        <P>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, 
            most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, 
            compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop 
            while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.</P>
        <p>A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, 
            when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot 
            a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. 
            The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.</p>
        <p>Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or 
            by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill.</p>
        <p>On offense, players may use a variety of shots â€“ 
            the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, 
            intercept passes</p>
