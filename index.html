        <p>Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, 
            in the United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.
             The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of 
             popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition</p>
        <P>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, 
            most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, 
            compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop 
            while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.</P>
        <p>A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, 
            when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot 
            a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. 
            The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.</p>
        <p>Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or 
            by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill.</p>
        <p>On offense, players may use a variety of shots – 
            the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, 
            intercept passes, or block shots</p>
        <p>The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. 
            The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, 
            a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or 
            the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implement the coach's 
            game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays</p>
